# DT228-OOP-2015-Data-Visualisation-Project
Data visualisation project for my Object Oriented Programming class in 2015.
In this project I intend to take a dataset of information relating to the emergency fire services of Ireland between the years 1996 and 2011
and represent that data visually using multiple different types of data visualisation, eg bar charts, trend graphs etc.

I altered the scope of my project so instead of using a dataset of information relating to the emergency fire services it now works off of a dataset
of census information of Ireland. The graphs used are a bar graph, line graph, pie chart, and a word cloud.

	WRITE UP:

	To start with on this project I made a BarGraph class with the appropriate fields and methods to be used in the draw method to draw the graph.
I also made a class for the dataset with the appropriate fields for each type of date being read in from the dataset. In this class is also a constructor
that takes in the data and separates it based on where there are tabs, which are what separate the different data types (year, total population, etc).
In the main tab I wrote a method to load in the dataset and store each line of it in an arraylist of the type of the class I'd made for the dataset.
Then I started to make a class for a line graph and realised I could use inheritance from a super class to save me having to repeat some of my code,
so I made a class called Graph that the LineGraph and BarGraph classes inherit (extend) from. In this are the variables and methods used to draw
the axes for the graphs, as the axes are the same for each graph.
	After that I went back to writing my LineGraph class, which was quite similar to my BarGraph class and truthfully I could likely include more
than just the
