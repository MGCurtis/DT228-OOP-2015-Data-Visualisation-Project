# DT228-OOP-2015-Data-Visualisation-Project
Data visualisation project for my Object Oriented Programming class in 2015.
In this project I intend to take a dataset of information relating to the emergency fire services of Ireland between the years 1996 and 2011
and represent that data visually using multiple different types of data visualisation, eg bar charts, trend graphs etc.
